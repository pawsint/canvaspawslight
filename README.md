Canvas PAWS Child Theme
============================

This is a downloadable Child-theme folder for WooThemes Canvas theme. This can be used for any WordPress theme, but is specifically set for the WooThemes Canvas theme.

## How do I use it?
------------------------
1. Make sure you have Woothemes Canvas (at least Version 5.3.0) installed, 2. Download the Child-Theme, 3. Upload the ZIP file through the "Themes > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.,4. Activate the Child-Theme through the 'Themes' menu in WordPress. 5. Access the features from the WooThemes Options Panel > PAWS Settings

## Can I change it?
------------------------
Yes! Its very easy. Just go to styles.css and change the Theme Name and Template Name fields to match your own theme. This will point the child theme to the parent theme of your choice. You can also copy any template files from your parent theme, so your changes don't get overwritten when upgrading.

## Can I contribute?
------------------------
…sure. But theres nothing more to this. If you want, make your own repository with a theme of your choice. Im sure there are people who can't figure out how to make changes to the style.css file. They probobley shouldnt be using this anyways…
